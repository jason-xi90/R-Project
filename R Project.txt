The project is to predict the result(Transported) of the test data from the train data. 
First of all, I imported the csv files to R and loaded the data. 
Next, I defined train.txt file as the train set, and Age as the factor correlating with Transported.
Then, I imported the randomForest package from R studio.
Finally, I established a model of to predict the Transported results for the test data using the train data.
In this project, there was some issue with the train.csv data and R studio did not allow me to relate the data to the model, so I just left it as-is.
